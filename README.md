# tic-tac-toe

What I learned:
How to moduralize my code and clean up the global namespace.
I used javascript to implement different pages/states for my web app.

State 1: Opening page - enter names then press start to play.

State 2: Game page - play with a friend! 

State 3: Declare winner or tie. You have an option to play again withthe same names or new players.
